1) [DONE] get the mean value of each of the oscillation
2) plot_fit.py plot the fitted oscillation with proper axis
3) plan the method to calculate the foot point of the loop

LOOP LENGTH
1) Path to the data files
2) path to the Loop in oscillations
3) path to the slit info
4) Plot the slit on the image
5) add a croping routine
6) plot the slit on this image as well
7) use the cropping info of x and plot take user input for distance
