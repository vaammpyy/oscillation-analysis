Fitting the loops with the errors bars
1) error in each of the column pixel value will be pixel value multiplied by the gain.
2) this error should be inputed in the sigma of the scipy to get the gaussian fit and the error in the peak will be the standard deviation of the gaussian.
3) save the error in the oscillation parameters in the same file as +-.
